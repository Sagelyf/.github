🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?

Sagelyf is a community-driven platform focused on creating innovative tools and solutions that merge technology with health, education, and community engagement. Our primary goal is to harness the power of open-source technology to build impactful applications, making resources more accessible and improving public health, security, and education outcomes.

At Sagelyf, we believe in empowering individuals through the development of easy-to-use, secure, and efficient tools, such as our ReactHookFormX Security Scan Tool, designed to ensure code security for developers. We strive to create a culture of learning, collaboration, and continuous improvement in both technology and community development.

🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?

At Sagelyf, we believe in fueling the mind and body. Our team loves a mix of traditional breakfasts—think avocado toast, oatmeal, and eggs—but we also have some adventurous souls who kickstart their day with smoothies, chai lattes, and the occasional morning taco! Whatever keeps us coding, learning, and innovating!
